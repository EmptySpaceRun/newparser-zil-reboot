### **** WARNING ****

   This is a heavily messy project and, in short, is barely for public use (just for
your own sanity). You really should only change the places, verbs, and syntax files,
Because those are fine with changing (though I wouldn't touch the IMAGES stuff.) If,
however, you do wish to change any other files to your liking, please keep a backup
frequently, because you'll REALLY need it.

   P-IMAGES is not for use: Half of the code still relates to the Zork Zero code and
I do not know how to use the blorb files for modifying to your own files. I just have
no idea. For that reason, I'd say one thing: PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM.

   The new-parser files ARE a work-in-progress, but the P-QUOTES function (found in
the DEFS file) are functional, so you can set the P-QUOTES compilation flag to T and
edit the QUOTES at the bottom to your liking. I also have left messages around the
code to direct you and help you. Otherwise, enjoy!
